        <h3>Description of the job:</h3>
        <p>
            In my first year of master's studies I took a 5Hp course called
            <a target="_blank" title="External link" href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1RT700"><i>Statistical Machine Learning</i></a> </small>
            at Uppsala University. The course was at master's level and was about learning the basic theory behind statical machine learning. At the end
            of the course we had a project about using Python to build a machine learning model that can
            classify the gender of leading actors (male/female) based on factors/features such as, gross income for the movie,
            gender of co-lead, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Questions such as <b>"Can Machine Learning methods be used in Classification problems?"</b> and/or
            <br>
            <b>"How will the accuracy and precision of the model be affected by the choice of features?"</b> were answered.
        </p>
        <h3>Project:</h3>
        <p>
            The project was done in a group of 4 people. The code is stored at a private repository on GitHub.
