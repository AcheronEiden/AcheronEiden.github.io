# AcheronEiden.github.io
Using this repo to get my own domain hosted at .github.io. 

* EDIT1: Tried to use my name as username but don't know if its possible without changing the username of the github account (as I want to
    keep AcheronEiden as my username XD).
* EDIT2: May feel weird that I don't have any comments or blank spaces between my code parts for better readability and understanding.
    The reason is that I deleted all comments as they made the code look "unprofessional" (XD) and  as this code is in a public repository
    I want it too look good for the readers. All code used are basic HTML/CSS and little javascript (maybe XD) so shouldn't be a problem
    to understand as long as you can basics of the languages.
  * EDIT2.1: My real code in a private repo is filled with comments and blank spaces for easier understanding etc. so if you want too see
        it contact me and I may invite you to the repository.
