            <!--Python-->
            <b class="language backend">Python</b> - The first programming language I learned. I have been programming in Python for about 4 years now.
            in my second yer of university I took a course in Python and learned the basics of the language. After that I fell
            in love with programming and since then have spent more time in learning the language. I have, in my spare time,
            used Python to create different projects. All of the projects are available on my GitHub page. Most of them are set to
            private but if you are interested in seeing them, please contact me and I will give you access to them.
            <br><br>
            <!--C++-->
            <b class="language backend">C++</b> - The second programming language I learned. I have been programming in C++ for about 2 years now. I learned
            the language mainly for a course I took called <br>
            <a target="_blank" title="External link" href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TE723">"Microcontroller Programming"</a>.
            The course was about programming microcontrollers in C++ and I learned the basics of the language there.
            Afterwards I also used C++ in addition to Arduino IDE to program an external screen together with some LEDs to show different
            animations. The code for that project is also available on my GitHub page and is stored at a
            <a target="_blank" title="External link to a public repository" href="https://github.com/AcheronEiden/MicrocontrollerProgramming">public repository</a>.
            <br><br>
            <!--JavaScript-->
            <b class="language frontend">JavaScript</b> - Learned this language together with HTML and CSS last summer (2023) to create a website for this CV.
            I have used JavaScript to create different functions for the website. For example, the function that makes the navigation
            bar responsive when the screen size is small. I also used JavaScript to create a function that makes the navigation bar
            change color hovering over it.

            <b class="language backend">Assembly (MIPS assembly)</b> - I am currently taking a course called
            <a target="_blank" title="External link" href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DT038">Computer Architecture 1</a>
            that is about computer architecture and assembly programming. I have learned the basics of MIPS assembly programming and is
            currently working on different programs in MIPS assembly. The reason I chose to learn MIPS assembly is because I want to
            learn more about how a computer works and how the different parts of a computer works together. I also want to learn more
            about how a computer processes different instructions and how the different parts of a computer works together to process
            those instructions.

            that is about functional programming and Haskell. I have learned the basics of Haskell and is currently working on a
            project to implement a so called "UltimateTicTacToeAI" in Haskell. The code is stored at a private repository on GitHub
            but available upon request.

            <!--R-->
            <b class="language backend">R</b> - In my third year of university I took a course called
            <a target="_blank" title="External link" href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1MS005">"Probability and Statistics"</a>
            where I used the programming language R to calculate different probabilities and statistics. Make note that this wasn't
            a programming course but a course in probability and statistics. I used R on my own for making sure that my hand calculations
            were correct. I also used R to create different graphs to visualize the data I had.

            I have used HTML to create the structure of the website and CSS to style the website. I have also used CSS to make the
            website responsive when the screen size is small. In addition, I used CSS to style the navigation bar and the footer.

            say, "MatLab is a powerful tool that every engineer should know how to use". I have used MatLab to solve different problems
            raging from solving a system of linear equations to solving a system of differential equations. I have also used MatLab to
            create different graphs to visualize the data I had.
