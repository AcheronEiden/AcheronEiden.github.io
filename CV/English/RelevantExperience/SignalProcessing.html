            <h3>Description of the job:</h3>
            <p>
                Did this project 1 year ago for a 10Hp course called
                <a target="_self" title="External link" href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TE651"><i>Signal Processing</i></a>.
                The course had a master's level difficulty and introduced some advanced theory regarding signal processing and how to use
                MatLab to process signals. At the end of the course we did a project about using MatLab to filter out noise from a music file
                and later analyzing the filtered music file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything was done using MatLab and so it wasn't saved in a repository on GitHub. No report was needed to be written
                for this project and no presentation was needed to be done so don't expect to find any report or presentation.
