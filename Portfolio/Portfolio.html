                            facilitate figure movement, animation, and dynamic addition/removal.
                            Mechanics for further addition of figures and color customization were also implemented.

                            This involved applying stencil computations to an array representing function values.
                            Initially, a serial version was implemented, followed by optimization using MPI to enhance

                            During the autumn of 2020, I developed a Python-based simulation showcasing the flow of
                            vehicles through a traffic light-controlled intersection.

                            During the autumn of 2023, I collaborated with <i>Andreas Hertzberg</i> to develop a C-based
                            project utilizing an Arduino micro-controller to animate an LCD screen.
                            We incorporated button-controlled animation sequencing, implemented through code handling
                            interrupts and timers.

                            <i>Erik Magnusson</i> on a Python-based project exploring
                            the potential of Machine Learning methods by predicting the gender of a movie's lead
