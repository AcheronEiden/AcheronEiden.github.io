                Title: Programming of the ventilation system for an electrical vehicle (EV)

            <h3>Description of the job:</h3>
            <p>
                This was the first large-scale project that I did in my bachelor's studies.
                The project was about converting a regular diesel-driven car to an electrical vehicle (EV).
                The whole team consisted of 40 students divided into 5 sub-teams. I was part of the sub-team
                responsible for the inner workings of the driving-system and was assigned to program the ventilation system.
                As we haven't really studied programming by that time, I had to use the toolbox LabView to program the ventilation system
                together with the FPGA card. The FPGA card was used to control the ventilation system and the LabView was used to program the FPGA card.
